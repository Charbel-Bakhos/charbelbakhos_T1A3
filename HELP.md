## Steps to install the application

## Any system/hardware requirements
This program requires your computer to have python3 installed to run. It can be run on Mac, Linux and Windows.

## How to use
Once you start up the application, after the home screen animation press enter to continue.
* You will be prompted to enter your age. The app only accepts ages between 0-122
* You will be prompted to enter your biological sex. The app only accepts M or F. This is only to print a strength standards table on the next screen (Males and females are considered advanced at different kilograms lifted for example)
* You will then be prompted to input how many days per week you would like to lift. The program will only accept between 3-6 days. Less than 3 is not enough to warrant an entire routine, and any more than 6 is too much. You need to rest!

You will then see your workout routine printed to the screen! Make sure you follow for at least 12 weeks before switching.
